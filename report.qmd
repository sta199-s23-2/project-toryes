Introduction and Data:

-   Where does your data come from? How was it sampled? Description of Observations

Data was first collected in 1983 and has been collected every year since then. HUD used to use surveys of local housing markets to collect data, but now housing authorities conduct surveys on their behalf. They also accept telephone or mailsurveys. - Collected by: The Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Public Development and Research (HUD's PD&R)

The data is divided by year then state and county. You can choose to view the whole state or just the county. The variables are year, state, counties, zip code, efficiency, one-bedroom, two-bedroom, three-bedroom, four-bedroom, and FMR percentile. - The years, efficiency, one-bedroom, two-bedroom, three-bedroom, four-bedroom, and FMR percentile are quantitative variables. The state is a categorial variables.

Methodology:

-   How do you plan to answer your research question?

I am defining post-Covid as 2022. To simplify the comparison, only 2019 and 2022 data from North Carolina will be used. The year 2019 will be directly compared to 2022 to show an example of pre-Covid rent prices vs. post-Covid rent prices. The rent prices of the one-bedroom, two-bedroom, three-bedroom, four-bedroom from these years will be used.

    -   Pediction, Interfernce, both?

We will verify our hypothesis using a linear regression model that looks how prices have changed in North Carolina as a result of Covid.
